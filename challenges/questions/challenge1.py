# Challenge 1
#
#   Description:
#
#   In this challenge you should create a program which prints out the even 
#   numbers up-to (and including) a single integer passed as an argument.
#
#   It does not matter how these numbers are printed (new lines or the same line)
#   Erroneous cases should be handled (consider them to be any negative integer)
#
#   Example test cases:
#
#   py challenge1.py 7 -> 0 2 4 6
#   py challenge1.py 12 -> 0 2 4 6 8 10 12
#   py challenge1.py -1 -> Error

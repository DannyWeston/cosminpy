# Challenge 3
#
#   Description:
#   
#   In this challenge, you will print out the area of a right-angled triangle 
#   when given its width and height which are given as two command line arguments
#
#   The formula for the area of a right angled triangle is:
#   0.5 * width * height
#   
#   Erroneous cases should be handled (wrong input type, negative integers, etc)
#
#   Example test cases:
#
#   py challenge1.py 7 2 -> 7
#   py challenge1.py 5 3 -> 7.5
#   py challenge1.py 0 0 -> 0
#   py challenge1.py 2 -> Error
#   py challenge1.py "hello" -> Error
#   py challenge1.py -1 0 -> Error
#
#   Bonus Marks: 
#
#   Print out some units after the area on the same line
#    
#   Example test case:
#
#   py challenge1.py 3 5 -> 7.5 cm^2
